# README

## Overview
This is a plain Java - Maven based project equipped with test automation capabilities. It's a playground project, where you will find the POCs (Proof of Concepts), solutions to some of the frequent problems, and examples of best coding practices that are relevant in software development.

## Contents
The project includes programs and examples related to:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **SOLID Principles**
- **Threading and Concurrency**

## Structure
The project is structured to help you easily navigate and understand different concepts:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java source code.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the test automation code using frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file, used to manage dependencies and build the project.
